Description: Provides probability mass, distribution, quantile, random-variate
    generation, and method-of-moments parameter-estimation functions for the
    Delaporte distribution with parameterization based on Vose (2008)
    <isbn:9780470512845>. The Delaporte is a discrete probability distribution
    which can be considered the convolution of a negative binomial distribution
    with a Poisson distribution. Alternatively, it can be considered a counting
    distribution with both Poisson and negative binomial components. It has been
    studied in actuarial science as a frequency distribution which has more
    variability than the Poisson, but less than the negative binomial.
