This repository is constructed as an R package, but its purpose is to serve as a test bed for the possible porting of the [Delaporte](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Delaporte) package for R from [Rcpp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp)/C++ to Fortran.

The author is grateful to [Drew Schmidt](https://github.com/wrathematics) both generally for his writings on R, C++, and Fortran and specifically for help with this project.
